# synchro-data
synchronise data between 2 applications

we have a first app that is the backoffice tool to manage customer contracts

the second app is our front office tool or CRM

when we create or update or delete a customer in the backoffice tool, we have to do the same thing

on the CRM in order to synchronise the 2 databases.
